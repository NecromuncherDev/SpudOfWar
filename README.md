Part of being a programmer in an organization or a place that got more than 1 person is to get code that you didn&#39;t write.
If it&#39;s a class, or a whole project, you need to know how to read the code and understand it.

That why this project is not &quot;Your&quot; game.

Each 1 of you will get at **random** a game from the projects you submitted **previous semester**.

You will need to do the following -

- **Update the project** to the latest Unity (2018.3) and solve compile errors and breaking scripts.
- Play the game a bit, **learn the code** by reading it, if you want you can ask the person who submitted it to explain the code and the project.
  - If you do, the person need to tell &quot;Shahar Bar&quot; this is important and a good thing that = bonus points for both. (a bit)
- **Come up with** an idea for a &quot; **Meta Feature**&quot;, meta feature is not a feature that is part of the gameplay but is around it. Like -
  - Stores for purchase
  - Popups for promotions
  - Leader boards
  - Ranks
  - Ads
  - All the things that keep the user return to the game and engage it
Most important for converting the user to be a paying user.

**Before you decide what is the feature please speak with &quot;Shahar Bar&quot; and get approval for the feature**

- **Develop the actual feature** to work with the existing game without causing new bugs in the already done game.

Submitting -

- **Open new Git** repository and share it with us (Tomer &amp; Shahar)
- **Commit in 1 (Initial) commit the full project** (Before the update) to develop branch -
  - Remember to commit only needed folders -
    - Assets
    - Project Settings
    - Packages
- **Checkout a different branch** for the new feature
- **Commit to this branch all you develop and the feature**.
- After you done **make a pull request to the develop** branch (Initial commit)
- **Send us the Pull Request,** you will be tested on that.

**You are tested on -** Every single bullet in that document.
From developing, updating, committing, and making the Git and PR.

My recommendation is to use separate commits, for example the update to Unity 2018.3 should be a commit, or even few.

**Due Dates -**

- Before - 4/4/2019 - Choose the actual feature and get green light to start work
- 18/4/2019 - Send us the Pull Request after development has finished
